WATER CONSUMPTION BILLING
SYSTEM 

Business Problem :
A Gated Community housing Facility in Chennai called “The Feathers Housing Community” with more than 500
houses is the scope of business problem here. Due to acute shortage of Water
in the city, such big housing communities cannot depend on metro water alone
for their day to day water needs. So they have decided to build a common water
tank, which will be filled regularly and water will be supplied to each house through
a metered connection. The community management has
decided to appoint a person to note the meter reading placed in each house and
receipt for amount based upon quantity of water consumed will be handed to
respective house owners. This system failed due to
unavailability of house owners during most of time when the appointed person
visits respective house to give receipt & collect money. To overcome this
painful process, management decides to go online. Design a software application
